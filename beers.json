This is not to suggest that complexity has been sacrificed, but rather that we seek to create clearer expressions of flavor and aroma in our beer, and ultimately to make beer that is balanced and drinkable.\r\n\r\nSimple Means takes inspiration from Altbier. Though classically associated with the copper ales of D�sseldorf, the term can refer to any older-style beer in the German-speaking world. Both the use of smoked malts and mixed fermentation with native yeast and bacteria predate modern brewing techniques, lending flavors to our farmhouse altbier that are evocative of a simpler, much earlier time.\r\n\r\nSimple Means was brewed with unfiltered, raw, Hill Country well water, malted barley, smoked malted barley, and hops in early September of 2015. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery in stainless steel for about two months. It was then 100% naturally conditioned through refermentation in the bottle for another two months prior to release.
