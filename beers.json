Fra Wikieddia, om �lbryggeren Christian Mumme: While Columbus was discovering America, Christian Mumme was developing a heavy, deep brown beer in Braunschweig, Germany. The beer was so strong the \"Maenner davon umfielen\" - Men would fall over after drinking it. In 1492 Braunschweiger Mumme was introduced to the market. The high alcohol and sugar content made Mumme an excellent staple for long sea voyages. It became a great export success in the 16th and 17th centuries. However, as tastes changed during the 18th century, the Mumme morphed into a alcohol free malt beverage - some call it the first \"Energy Drink\". In the final days of the beer style, it could only be found in health stores and pharmacies.

the brew into the rich darkness. The beer is unfiltered and unfined, so there will be a small amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  XVIII is best enjoyed poured carefully into a half filled brandy snifter or wine glass.  Allow it to warm to 55F to fully enjoy the pleasing and complex aromas. As the beer sits and breathes in the glass, rich dark chocolate, toasted oak and dark fruit character is revealed, so take your time. If you wait to open your bottle later, store it in a cool dark place. I suspect that this beer will age well and change favorably for years to come. It was an absolute pleasure in the making and I truly hope you enjoy our ninth oak-aged blend! The journey continues and it�s just as fun and exciting now as it was back in 1996. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis beer is dedicated to Jake and the rest of the amazing Wolfe family who have supported this community, our brewery and me personally since the beginning.

Brewmaster Mitch Steele reached for and subsequently improved on that pilot recipe, bringing it to life as part of the Stone Stochasticity Project. The result is a quad that�s lower in sweetness, but rich with dried fruit and spice nuances. \r\nAppearance:Pours deep chestnut with a light tan creamy head.\r\nAroma:Tropical fruit, banana and brown sugar, as well as some light pepper and clove flavors from Ardennes yeast.\r\nTaste:Fruity, molasses, brown sugar and banana flavors.

The classic episode, �The Trouble with Tribbles,� referenced a type of grain called quadrotriticale (pronounced �qu�dro-tr�tĭ-kay-lee�). As described in the episode, this was a high-yield, four-lobed grain hybrid of wheat and rye with a bluish color.

Though classically associated with the copper ales of D�sseldorf, the term can refer to any older-style beer in the German-speaking world. Both the use of smoked malts and mixed fermentation with native yeast and bacteria predate modern brewing techniques, lending flavors to our farmhouse altbier that are evocative of a simpler, much earlier time.\r\n\r\nSimple Means was brewed with unfiltered, raw, Hill Country well water, malted barley, smoked malted barley, and hops in early September of 2015. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery in stainless steel for about two months. It was then 100% naturally conditioned through refermentation in the bottle for another two months prior to release.

For Multifarious, we sought to achieve complex results through a very simple process. We took the classic, comforting texture and aroma of oatmeal stout, added a different dimension with smoked malt, and let it slowly evolve through mixed culture fermentation with native yeast and bacteria. It was brewed with the mindset of creating a beer that is subtle, succinct, and above all � drinkable. It�s no secret at this point that we�ve been intrigued for quite some time now with subtlety, simplicity, and restraint. We often measure our work by asking the question, �Would we want to drink a full glass of this beer, and then ask for another?� In working with 18th Street Brewery on Multifarious, we feel we were able to achieve this!\r\n\r\nMultifarious was brewed on November 18th, 2015 with raw Hill Country well water, malted barley, malted wheat, oats, and hops, and was fermented in stainless steel with our mixed culture of brewers yeast, and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the land and air around our brewery. It is 100% naturally conditioned through refermentation in bottles, kegs, and casks. At the time of packaging, Multifarious was 6.6% alcohol by volume, 34 IBU, 4.2 pH, and 1.005 specific gravity.
